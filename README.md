# Graph-Coloring-Problem

This repository provides an implementation of graph coloring algorithms using Backtracking, Greedy, and Dynamic Programming approaches. Users can select their preferred method to color a given graph efficiently.

# Features

**Backtracking Algorithm**: Ensures an optimal solution but may be slow for large graphs.

**Greedy Algorithm**: Fast but may not always provide the optimal coloring.

**Dynamic Programming Approach**: Balances performance and optimality for certain cases.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Visually represents the graph and its coloring. Supports user-defined graphs and visualization of results.
